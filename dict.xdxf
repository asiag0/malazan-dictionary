Arkady was always hungry for a good fight, and would bare his teeth in a "savage grin" when the prospect of one arose. The scout was usually silent unless speech was needed. Unlike almost all Wickans, Arkady did not have a horse - having sometime in the past made a vow that apparently involved not owning and/or riding one. As a Wickan, he was sometimes teased about this very uncharacteristic lack by his comrades.</deftext></def>

Nightmaria followed a strict policy of isolationism - with all of its well-guarded borders closed to outsiders,- and, as a result, little was actually known about its people. Since the little that was assumed to be true of the Nightmarians was negative in the extreme, nonresidents felt that "Fiends" was an appropriate name for what they had come to believe were "unhuman lizard people", of unsettling "hideousness". As it happened, the only 'Fiend' directly known - as such - to the Farrogese was the Nightmarian Ambassador to Farrog, <kref>Ophal D'Neeth Flatroq</kref>. The Ambassador's unique appearance and behaviors were certainly unpleasant enough to make almost anyone's "skin crawl and creep".</deftext></def>

Khun-Sen became de facto ruler of the Keep and his people - male and female, soldiers and civilians - became his court. Even there, however, Khun-Sen managed to earn the further displeasure of the Ruling Circle, which provoked from the Circle additional severe disciplinary measures upon Khun-Sen and his people. Over time, Chanar Keep and its inhabitants gained a reputation, at least amongst the superstitious, for being, at best, an "ill-omened place"-210,</deftext></def>

Its long, edged beak was broad, pointed and pelican-like. Although Koro could fly easily and rapidly, the creature's wings did "not appear in anyway adequate" to even just keep it up in the air.

Lek's swollen club feet caused her to limp badly with a "shuffling slow gait". It was observed that Lek possessed "a quiet dignity" and was "wise beyond her years". She was clad in a simple white robe loosely wrapped around her body and she wore a single, long braid that fell to one shoulder from her shaven scalp. Although Ardata denied that Lek was actually her daughter, it was suggested that this denial was due to Ardata wishing to keep the deformed Lek hidden and/or protected from strangers. </deftext></def>

            <def><deftext>A "Long Night" was a major magical manifestation which, when invoked by ritual, stopped time. As long as the 'Long Night' was in effect: ambient temperatures plummeted; the stars did not twinkle, but shone with a "strange, dull light"; the moon neither rose nor set; fires were heatless and their flames were "frozen" in place above their embers; and the "vigour of life" was suspended. This suspension of time of a 'Long Night' could encompass an area as large as a plain, or a space as small as that enclosing a single individual. A not uncommon, non-magical form of the 'Long Night' - known simply as a long night - could take place during a dying person's final night. This long night would be co-terminous with the actual night, and dawn would find that death had arrived and had claimed the dying.</deftext></def>

The Red Fort was surrounded by ravens, which apparently were attracted to its crenellations. The fortress, which was quite large for its location, was surrounded by tall walls of stone - which gave the impression of blending into the natural rocky cliffs on which it stood. Most of the enclosed space within the walls was taken up by a square inner tower, also made of stone. Men and women of the Crimson Guard patrolled the walls. Members of the Guard were stationed at the Red Fort for relatively long tours of duty there. Periodically, a mule train out of <kref>New Seti</kref> made its circuitous way into the Fenn Range to resupply the fort and to bring fresh Guard members to relieve the existing group at the fort.

            <def><deftext>The core foundations for the Malazan novels of <kref>Steven Erikson</kref> and <kref>Ian C. Esslemont</kref> were born in the role-playing game sessions they began at Canada's University of Victoria in the 1980s.  The two were flatmates while attending the college's creative writing program and shared similar interests in history, archaeology, and anthropology. They started with "Dungeons &amp; Dragons", but soon found the game system "too mechanical and on occasion nonsensical" so they moved on to "GURPS (the Generic Universal Roleplaying System)", which offered the spontaneous narrative flexibility they were looking for.  Although role-playing games tend to be designed with the idea that a single referee guides the actions of multiple players through an adventure scenario, Erikson and Esslemont played one-on-one sessions with each alternating as referee and player.</deftext></def>

The talespinner told two different stories about the moon: in one the moon was simply an innocent gift from <kref>Father Light</kref> to <kref>Mother Dark</kref> to remind her of his great love for her - a bright light in the dark sky; the second was far more complex - that if it were possible to travel the vast distance to the moon and to then look back towards the earth from the rear of the moon, it would be found that it was, in fact, a lens, belonging to one of Father Light's eyes, and that if one looked through it one would see other worlds for which the moon was not the moon but, rather, the sun. As the storyteller had then put it, "Perspective...[t]he world changes according to where [one stands]" - the moral being that a particular situation to be dealt with can look very different depending on the direction that one looked at it from, and so it was important to choose carefully, very carefully, as to where one's stand would be.</deftext></def>
